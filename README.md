Very basic layout, based loosely on TI's EMK board, with component LCSC numbers cribbed from the M17 project's "Exploded M17" project.  matching network should be loosely around 440 mhz but you'll want to customize for your application.

I'm not an RF engineer or PCB layout expert, so use at your own risk.  Pull requests welcome if you know better than I do on anything here.  

License is unlicense, use it how you want to, I don't consider this to be intellectual property, it's just a combination of parts following datasheets and sample layouts.
